# JAMStack personal blog - starter files

These are the starting files used by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) to create a personal blog site for the [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/) DevProjects Challenge, [Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-fast-and-secure-blog-using-jamstack-c93coupnxb). I used them to execute the challenge without worrying about the content or styling.

The `src` folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

- HTML files to use as a base for the different page layouts. These can be turned into the templates that will be used.
- CSS file for styling the pages
- 5 blog articles in the `blog` folder
- images and a logo in the `assets` folder

The articles are written in Markdown, and include Front Matter. 

## Tutorial

I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin used Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.
